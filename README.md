# Bark Book
Host or attend meetups for your dog to hang out with other dogs and meet new dog pals. It can be hard for old dogs to make new friends, so we’re designing a platform for dog owners to socialize with each other and each other's doggos. An active dog is a happy dog. Our platform will be a place to create and store fun memories you’ve made with your furry pals. 

## Features
Web app. Users create an account, and profiles for their dog(s). They can create and/or sign up to meetups, for social dog walks. 

## Tech Stack
Spring Boot, ReactJS, SQL, with Google Places & Maps API integration

## Running the application
Not yet ready for production build process. 

### Requirements
`npm`, `JDK 17`, some `SQL` instance.

### Build 
Download repo.
Open the API in a Java IDE. Inspect the `application.properties` for SQL settings.
Spin up an SQL server. `bootRun` with gradle.
For the front end, open the UI folder, run `npm i`, then `npm run dev`.

You can now open the application at the URI indicated by npm: normally http://localhost:5173/
